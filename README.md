# Employee Satisfaction & Engagement Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between employee satisfaction and employee engagement using Glassdoor review data. By analyzing various engagement driversâ€”such as work-life balance, compensation, career opportunities, and company cultureâ€”we aim to identify trends, biases, and key factors influencing employee retention and productivity.

## Dataset
Source: Glassdoor employee reviews dataset
Size: 800K+ reviews from multiple companies across industries in the UK

## Key Features:
Overall Rating (1-5)
Sub-ratings: Career Opportunities, Compensation & Benefits, Culture & Values, Senior Management, Work/Life Balance
Recommendation (Would the employee recommend the company?)
CEO Approval
Company Outlook
Project Goals
Analyze Employee Engagement Drivers

### Identify key factors affecting engagement.
Compare engagement trends across top-rated and bottom-rated companies.
Examine Company Performance & Satisfaction

### Compare engagement across different organizations.
Investigate the impact of leadership, culture, and compensation.
Detect Biases & Patterns in Reviews

## Explore trends in negative feedback.
Identify potential employee biases in ratings.

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and outliers.
Standardized rating scales for comparison.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution of ratings across industries.
Trends in employee recommendations & CEO approval.
Sentiment analysis on employee comments.

## Key Findings
âœ… Work-life balance & compensation strongly correlate with overall satisfaction.

âœ… Top-rated companies maintain consistent engagement levels across factors.

âœ… Poor leadership is a common complaint in low-rated companies.

âœ… Employee biases can influence ratings (e.g., extreme scores in certain industries).

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Next Steps & Future Work
ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning Predictions: Forecast employee satisfaction based on past reviews.

ðŸ”¹ Company-Specific Recommendations: Provide insights for improving engagement.

ðŸ”¹ Financial Integration: Assess the impact of engagement on company revenue.

## Project Status 
this project was done for my Data Analysis Bootcamp Class where we had to use Python (Jupiter Notebook) and analyze the topic using Python
